		<p>virtuwell had a campaign idea. They knew their key public, but they didn&#8217;t know was the best channels and messages to use. TommComm worked closely with the virtuwell marketing team to research, brainstorm, and develop strategies to increase the brand&#8217;s engagement with 18- to 24-year-olds. We planned events, identified messages, and storyboarded paid advertisements. By the end of the collaboration, virtuwell had scalable solutions that met their business goals and a campaign plan detailing the strategies and information critical for moving forward.</p>

		<p>Tony Fisher is a UST alum, a former Target executive, and now the owner and president of K1 Sportswear. When asked to speak at the April 2017 First Friday event, Tony knew he wanted to involve students throughout the entire process. TommComm worked closely with Tony and his mentee, Amanda Post, to structure the content, create the visuals, and plan the logistics of his presentation. By the time of the presentation, Tony only had to walk into the event with the script he had personalized and present to the audience that was waiting to hear him.</p>
