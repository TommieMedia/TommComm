		<h2>OUR TEAM</h2>

					<p class="team_heading">Director</p>
					<p><strong>Claire Rossez</strong></p>
					<p>Claire is a St. Thomas senior double majoring in Communication and Journalism (COJO) and English, and minoring in French.  She would love to have a career that combines her passion for writing with her love of working in teams.  Although she wants to get some work experience first, Claire hopes to go to grad school someday to get a Masters in either communication or business.</p>

					<p>Being a full-time student with multiple on-campus jobs keeps Claire busy, but she enjoys spending time with friends and exploring the Twin Cities in her time off.  She&#8217;s always up for talking about books, movies, or popular TV shows (but don&#8217;t get her started on the ending of How I Met Your Mother&mdash;still too soon).  She loves to laugh, especially at bad dad jokes and corny puns, and tries to find the humor in everything.</p>

					<p><strong>Sam Shay</strong>
					<p>Sam is a Communications and Journalism major (not so much the journalism part, however) as well as a Catholic Studies major, and he loves studying each subject. He commonly tells people when they ask why he&#8217;s in school that, while he loves talking, he should learn how to do it and when to stop. His other passions are writing, listening to music, running, and video gaming. He is excited about his role in TommComm as Assistant Director, and looks forward to working with the TommComm team!</p>

						<p><strong>Anne Kopas</strong></p>
						<p>Anne is a St. Thomas senior double-majoring in English and Communications, minoring in psychology. She came into college thinking that the Communications major was just a side gig to keep her away from life as a starving novelist, so she&#8217; not quite sure how she got here. She&#8217;s the web manager for TommieMedia, and she&#8217;s been involved in the local publishing scene through internships with Minnesota Business Magazine and Redleaf Press. At any given time, there&#8217;s an extremely high probability that she is blasting her music, running, over her head in novel revisions, drinking tea, or some combination thereof.</p>
