<p>The Social Innovation Collaboratory is an organization at St. Thomas that fosters social innovation by creating relationships between the university, students, and the community. They work to prove that everyone has the ability to be a changemaker, or in their words, "Someone who has the freedom, confidence, grit, and societal support to address social problems and change -- all for the common good."</p>
<p>When TommComm was still a classroom project, the Social Innovation Collaboratory was our first client. Our small team of videographers met with the faculty and student changemakers to create a promotional video that introduces the organization and its work and will be featured on their website. TommComm admires the Social Innovation Collaboratory's dedication to inspiring and enacting social innovation, and we are excited to work with them more in the future.</p>


<p>Tony Fisher is a UST alum, a former Target executive, and now the owner and president of K1 Sportswear. When asked to speak at the April 2017 First Friday event, Tony knew he wanted to involve students throughout the entire process. TommComm has been working closely with Tony and his mentee, Amanda Post, to structure the content, create the visuals, and plan the logistics of his presentation.</p>
<p>Tickets are available online for Tony's First Friday at 11:30 a.m. on April 7 in Woulfe Alumni Hall.</p>

<p>You don't have to travel to the Kennedy Space Center to let your imagination soar while you learn about the aerospace industry. AirSpace Minnesota is a local nonprofit that highlights Minnesota's active role in the field to show students that they too can dream big. Finding a passion for STEM classes early and maintaining that enthusiasm throughout school is key for Minnesota's future pilots, astronauts, and other aerospace professionals. That's why AirSpace Minnesota works hard to encourage Minnesota's students to stick with STEM classes and shoot for the stars.</p>
<p>TommComm's realtionship with AirSpace Minnesota also has its roots in a class project. A COJO 234 group laid the groundwork for us to take over creating a sustainable system for generating monthly newsletters. When we're done, AirSpace Minnesota will have three completed newsletters, a template for creating future issues, and a strategic plan that coordinates releasing supplemental communications through various mediums.</p>
