		<h1>Our Story</h1>
	</div>
	<div id="story">
		<p>Tommie Communications began as an idea presented to a class of St. Thomas students. It didn&#8217;t have a vision, a workplace, or even a name. What it did have was 12 dedicated students, strong faculty and community support, and a catchy nickname: TommComm.</p>
		
		<p>Today, TommComm is a full-service student-run communications agency. We partner with <i>real</i> clients on <i>real</i> projects so our employees gain experience in the communication field. And because we&#8217;re still growing, we have experienced faculty advisers who help us along the way.</p>
		
		<p>TommComm knows that students have talents, knowledge, and perspectives that are valuable to organizations throughout the community. Our work benefits not only our clients, but also the people they serve and our student employees. TommComm is dedicated to advancing the commong good.</p>
				
		<p>Because youthful insights and modern perspectives are the focus at TommComm, creativity is encouraged, fostered, and manifested in projects that are promptly delivered and suited to the needs of our clients.</p>
